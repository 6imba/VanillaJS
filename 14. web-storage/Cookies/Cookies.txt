
- How do we make server remember or trace a visitor.

- we can set cookies in express without any other extra packages dependencies.(server1.js)
- but if you want to read the incomming cookies being sent from the browser, you do need to install apackage.
    - i.e cookies-parser
    - npm i cookie-parser
    (server2.js)

- this is when cookies are useful as:
    - you can set them once,
    - then browser will automatically sends those setted cookies to the server-side along with each and every http request, regardless of http request methods.

- here we have access the cookie from server-side.
- also we can access the cookie from clinet-side in browser.
    - go to console of browser and code js: document.cookie ==> you will get cookie data.
        - document.cookie
        - 'name=Amir; age=22; species=being a human'

- In certain extend its good to allow client to access cookie until you are not storing some private or security related data.
- but you can disable client side javascript access.


- Once you set the cookie you can access cookie data through all tab of browser, till the browser page lies in same domain(localhost:, abc.com:, etc) irrespective to port number.
