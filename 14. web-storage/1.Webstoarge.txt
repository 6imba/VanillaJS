- web storage: store some of details about web_sites on web_browser_memory.
- also known as storage.
- supports persistent data storage in web browser(see data of web page even when you close and open browser again{local storage})
- storage varies from browser to browser(MB).

# HTML5 web storage VS cookies.
    - Web Storage(local and session): 8MB  
    - cookie: 4KB  

# What is HTML5 Web Storage?
    - With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
    - The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.

    - Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request.
    - Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
    - Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.
    - Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.

# HTML Web Storage Objects(HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:):
    - window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
    - window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

# HTML5 Web Local Storage VS HTML5 Web Session Storage:
    > Local Storage:
        - The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
        - Accessible from all window tab.
        - window.localStorage.setItem("key":"value")
        - window.localStorage.getItem("key")
        - window.localStorage.key = "value"
        - window.localStorage.key
        - localStorage.removeItem('key')
        - localStorage.clear()
    > Session Storage:
        - The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab.
        - Accessible from same window tab only.
        - It stores data only for one session. Here one session is one window tab.
        - window.sessionStorage.hits
