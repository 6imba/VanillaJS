Listening to the event.


The addEventListener() is a JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener method that attaches an event handler to the specified element.


Add an event listener that fires when a user clicks a button:
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", displayDate);


The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.
You can add many event handlers to one element.
You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two "click" events.
You can easily remove an event listener by using the removeEventListener() method.
