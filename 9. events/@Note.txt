- JS events are "things" that the browser does, or something a user does/happen to HTML elements.
- JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
- That code is called EventHandler which allow you to react on, when certain things happens on page.

* Here are some examples of HTML events:
    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked
    When a user clicks the mouse
    When a web page has loaded
    When an image has been loaded
    When the mouse moves over an element
    When an input field is changed
    When an HTML form is submitted
    When a user strokes a key

# Assign Events to HTML elements by using:
    * HTML event atrributes inside html_element_tags. ==> inline events: onclick, onsubmit
    * HTML DOM event-property inside script_tag.
    * event-atrribute-value: either direct-JS-code or Call-Js-funtion.
    * HTML DOM setAttribute() Method
    * addEventListener() ~ JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener method

Q. setAttribute VS addEventListener?

- addButton.onclick = addTask

- event object can be found in event handler funtion only.

    const eventHandler = (event) => {
      console.log("Console event object from event handler function: "+event)
      callFunc();
    }

    const callFunc = (event) => {
      console.log("Trying to console event object from event handler function: "+event)
    }

What is the first required argument of event listeners?
Event listeners only take one argument, the Event Object, which is automatically passed to the listener, and the return value is ignored.
