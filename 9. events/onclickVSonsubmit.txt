# Form form submission onclick and onsubmit:
    - onsubmit can only be used on the form, it will be triggered before submitting the form,
    - onclick is used by buttons and other controls to trigger click events.

- Before submitting the form, data verification is generally performed.
- You can choose to verify in onclick on the submit button, or verify in onsubmit.

- But onclick is triggered earlier than onsubmit.(& onsubmit can be placed on form tag only.)

1. The user clicks the button —->

2. Trigger onclick event —->

3. Onclick returns true or onclick is not processed —->

4. Trigger onsubmit event —->

5. Onsubmit is not processed or returns true ——>

6. Submit the form.

7.  The onsubmit processing function returns false and the onclick function returns false, neither will cause the form to be submitted.

8. Which would be the reasons to ever use the onclick of a submit button to determine whether or not the form should be submitted?
