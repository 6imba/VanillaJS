- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.
- In JavaScript var, let and const, they are all hoisted to the top of their scope.

- In JavaScript variable declared with let and const keyword are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but not initialized(so gives error).
- Where as variables declaerd with var keyword is hoisted to the top of their global scope and initialized with undefined.

- JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
- To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
