- Function Define,

- Function Invocation/Call:
	- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
		- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
		- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
		- Automatically (self invoked)
	- The () Operator Invokes the Function

- Function Return

- Why Functions?
	==> You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

- Functions Used as Variable Values.
- Local Variables.
