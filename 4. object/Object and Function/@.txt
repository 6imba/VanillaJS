- JS function is method of Global object.
- Every function in JavaScript is method of object(either local or global)

- With the call(),apply() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
    - The call() method takes arguments separately. ====> functionName.call(objectName, "arg1", "arg1");
    - The apply() method takes arguments as an array. ====> functionName.apply(objectName, ["arg1", "arg1"]);

- With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.
    ====> functionName.bind(objectName);
