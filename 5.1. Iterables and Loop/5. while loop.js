// # for while loop iterate for time specified condition is satisfied.
// we use for_loop when we actually dont know the number of iteration we are gonna have.

let i = 0;
while(i<5){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}



// Q. Which loop is better for or while?
    // In general, you should use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run. If you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, you should use a while loop.
