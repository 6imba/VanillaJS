- Data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more are called iterable object.

# Different Kinds of Loops in JavaScript:
    > for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
    > for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
    > for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
    > forEach - method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.
    > while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
    > do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

# iterable,iterate,iteration,iterator:
    - Iterable: Iterable is an object which can be looped over or iterated over with the help of a for loop.
    - Iterate/Iterated: looped over/ performing looping.
    - Iteration: a single loop cycle.
    - iterator: dummy loop temporaty variable(i)

// The spread operator allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array, map, or set.
// The spread operator allows you to spread out property(key-value_pair) of an object.
// In JavaScript, Object s are not iterable unless they implement the iterable protocol.
// Therefore, you cannot use for...of to iterate over the properties of an object.

Q. iteration protocols?

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
