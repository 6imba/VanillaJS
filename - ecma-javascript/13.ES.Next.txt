# Wikipedia:
    - ES.Next is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing.
    - ES.Next features include finished proposals (aka "stage 4 proposals") as listed at finished proposals that are not part of a ratified specification.
    - The language committee follows a "living spec" model, so these changes are part of the standard, and ratification is a formality.
