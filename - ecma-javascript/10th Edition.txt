    # Features included:
        > Array.prototype.flat,
        > Array.prototype.flatMap,
        > changes to Array.sort,
            - Array.sort is now guaranteed to be stable, meaning that elements with the same sorting precedence will appear in the same order in the sorted array.
        > changes to Object.fromEntries,
            - Array.prototype.flat(depth=1) flattens an array to a specified depth, meaning that all subarray elements (up to the specified depth) are concatenated recursively.
        > Another notable change is that so-called catch binding became optional.
        > Changes to JavaScript Classes:  field declarations, private methods and fields, and static methods and fields.
        > String trimStart() and trimEnd()
        > Bigger Numbers with BigInt
        > Flatten Arrays with flat() and flatMap()
