            - a new mathematical operator called exponentiation operator
            - exponentiation operator ** for numbers,

        > JavaScript Array.prototype.includes:
            - Array.includes()

        > await, async keywords for asynchronous programming (as a preparation for ES2017),
            - async / await was hailed as an easier way to use promises and develop asynchronous code.
        > block-scoping of variables and functions,
        > destructuring patterns (of variables),
        > proper tail calls,
