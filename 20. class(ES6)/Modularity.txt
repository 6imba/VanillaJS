Modularity in js means to split the code in different files.
When a single file contains huge line of codes it create confussion and difficulty while read the code. So here comes the concept of modularity which simply means to split/break related code/statement accross different modules/files.
And each files are call modules.
Modules concept in JavaScript begins from ES6.
Modularizing an application. like moving each classes in seperate files. due to which our application is more maintainable.
Make class, function in module public by exporting it and import the exported class, function from other module.
Default exports. -> import ... from '';
Name export. -> import {...} from '';
importing from own module vs  importing from third party libary(install first).
