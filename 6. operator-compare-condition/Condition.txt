if else statement
switch statement
ternery operator
&& operator

  - A contrasting example could be a ternary expression vs. an if statement. Both are used for conditional branching in the code.


# condition:
if (myAge < 18){
	document.write("You are kid!");
}else if(myAge > 18 & myAge < 30){
	document.write("You are adult!");
}else{
	document.write("You are man!");
}
