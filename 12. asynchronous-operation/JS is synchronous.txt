- JavaScript is synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language by default.
- That just means that only one operation can be in progress at a time.
- JavaScript, however, is single threaded and only one line of code can be executed at any given time.
- Since, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it is synchronous in nature.
- Synchronous JavaScript: As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a sequence. i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one(back to back). So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed.
- Synchronous with a single thread : Tasks are executed one after another. Each task waits for its previous task to get executed.
- Thus, JavaScript is single-threaded, blocking , synchronous language by default.


- JavaScript is only asynchronous in the sense that it can make, for example, Ajax calls.
- In the context of programming, Parallelism is the utilization of multiple threads in an operating system.
- JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, it can be really easy to implement as we don't have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like deadlock.
- Since, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it is synchronous in nature.

- Async programming is about non-blocking execution between functions, and we can apply async with single-threaded or multithreaded programming.
- 

- When is JavaScript Synchronous and when is JavaScript Asynchronous.

-JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent programming language with lots of flexibility.
