- fetch() method always only work with server that returns data.
- so you cannot just fetch data from file in your local system, you also have to host them.
    - either host by Xampp, Wampp, VS_Code_LiveServer, Node_http_module_Server, Experss_Server, etc.
- if you want to just fetch data from file in your local system, you can use node fs module.

- Some of Liver Server: Xampp, Wampp, VS_Code_LiveServer.

- here, fetch() method in fetch.html request and get response of text_data inside content/localTextFile.txt beecause of LiverServer extention of VS_Code.

# Note:
    - when we open fetch.html from vscode liver server we get response.
    - but if we open fetch.html directly from OS_file_explorer you get error: TypeError: Failed to fetch.
