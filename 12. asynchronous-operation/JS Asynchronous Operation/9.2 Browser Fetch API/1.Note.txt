- Fetch API built-in into the browser.
- Fetch API built-in into the browser inorder to make asynchronous request.
- Fetch API built-in into the browser inorder to make asynchronous request to different network resources.
- Fetch API built-in into the browser inorder to make asynchronous request to different network resources by using HTTP methods (get, post, put, patch, etc).

- The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface.
- The Fetch API provides a JavaScript-Interface with fetch() method.
- The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
  It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
- This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest.

- As window is global object of browser and window object owns fetch(). See as fetch() is not recognized in node.js.
    - console.log(fetch()) ==> ReferenceError: fetch is not defined

- So, use fetch() in browser/ client side. 3.fetchAPI.html.

- JavaScript | fetch() Method.
    - The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages.
    - The request can be of any APIs that returns the data of the format JSON or XML. This method returns a promise.

- As we know that our API url response array of only 10 user data.
  - So if request for worng id API-url it will return error.
  - See file 8.fetchAPI.html

- The Fetch API interface allows web browser to make HTTP requests to web servers.
- No need for XMLHttpRequest anymore.
- fecth() method returns promises.

Q. How fetch data from API using Fetch?
  - Approach: First make the necessary JavaScript file, HTML file and CSS file. Then store the API URL in a variable (here api_url). Define a async function (here getapi()) and pass api_url in that function. Define a constant response and store the fetched data by await fetch() method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fetch API provides a method call fetch: fetch().
- This fetch() method is already defined in window_object.
  - & window_object is global_variable of a browser.
- This fetch() method returns a promise_object.
- & We know that wheever promise_object is returned by any object/method, we can retrive/fetch/get the promise_object using .then()&.catch() method manipulated the resopnse in promise_object.
-

- fetch() method takes two argument: url & object
  - where url is required & object is optional
  - url: The URL on which the request is to be made.
  - object:  An object which consists of additional properties that can be sent to the server.
