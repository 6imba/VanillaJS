<!-- here; -> fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/11') -> doesnt exist; //try-3 -->
<!-- as requested page doesnt exist, we get 404 error as response -->
<!-- See that our GET request happens but also our .then successful code gets executed. even though 404 status is returned by fetch(). But i thought that as 404 is returned its should have executed .catch() method -->
<!-- This is because the way fetch works, even though we are getting 404 failure response, fecth always successeds unless some sort of network error OR error in fetch itself(not with API we are calling). -->
<!-- unless some sort of network error: disconnet wifi and check the above code, you will see .then() doesnt excute but .catch() gets xecuted -->

<!-- So what you can do is check if response is ok or not. -->
