# AJAX stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML(JSON|CSV...)"
    - Asynchronous JavaScript Programming is Single-Main-Thread, perform multiple tasks, Non-blocking, Non-wait.
    - XML|JSON|CSV... are the data formate on which data can be exchanged between client and server.

# AAX implementation:
    - AJAX is set of technologies to perform Asynchronous JavaScript while data transmission.
    - Browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object is used for the implementation/achieving of AJAX programming. (Fetch API is also used nowadays)
    - It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.
    - XMLHttpResponse object
    - Fetch API: Fetch is an interface for making an AJAX request in JavaScript.

- Basically, AJAX is set of technologies use on the client-side:
    - Asynchronous JavaScript,
    - XML/JSON(Modern websites use JSON instead of XML for data transfer.)

# Using AJAX tech in our project.
    - AJAX helps to fetch data asynchronously.
    - AJAX helps to fetch data asynchronously without interfering current existing page.
    - Non blocking & No Page Reload/Referesh.
    - Better user experience.
    - Save network bandwidth.
    - Very Interractive.
    - Clinet Browser Page <---------- request/response ---------> Server

    - With Ajax, web applications frontend can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

- File formate: JS
- File extension: .JS

Q. What is AJAX?
    - AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
    - AJAX is not a programming language.
    - AJAX just uses a combination of:
        * A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server).
        * JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

    - AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.
    - AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
        - This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

# How AJAX Works:
    1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
    2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
    3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
    4. The server processes the request
    5. The server sends a response back to the web page
    6. The response is read by JavaScript
    7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

# The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.
    - All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.
    - The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

# Create an XMLHttpRequest Object
    - All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge (and IE7+), Safari, Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.
    - const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
