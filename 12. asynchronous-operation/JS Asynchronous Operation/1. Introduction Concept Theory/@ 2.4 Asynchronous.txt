# Asynchronous:
    - asynchronous Functions will finish later.
    - asynchronous Functions takes some time to finished. like: setTimeout, setInterval
    - asynchronous Functions runs in parallel with other functions.
    - doesn't happen at the same time.
    - doesn't happen at the same time but happen together with other function parallely & no wait.
    - This means that asynchronous is a function that takes some time to finish but doesnt makes program flow stop/wait as it runs along with another statment parallely.
    - runs parallel but not at the same time wait, both runs at their own pace.
    - doesn't happen at the same time. (Not Wait)
    - In Software design, Asynchronous software design expands upon the concept by building code that allows a program to ask that a task be performed alongside the original task (or tasks), without stopping to wait for the task to complete.
    - Therfore, asynchronous runs paralell with program flow abd alongside callback, but doesnt stops/make wait program flow instead makes callback inside asynchronous wait for taken time period.

Q. serial vs parallel vs concurent.
Q. Does asynchronous means parallel?

# Single Thread ==> Serial Data Transmission: So either synchronous or asynchronous.

# Synchronous:
	- happens at the same time,
    - waits,
    - Blocking I/O,

# Asynchronous:
	- doesn't happens at the same time,
    - doesnt waits,
    - Non-Blocking I/O,

# Page reloading with vs without AJAX use.

# Synchronous Programming vs Asynchronous Programming:
    - Synchronous Programming: task1(12 econds) + task1(15 econds) ==> Total time for task completion is 27 seconds, Waits, Blocking-calls, Single task at a time,
    - Asynchronous Programming: task1(12 econds) + task1(15 econds) ==> Total time for task completion is 15 seconds, No Waits, Non-Blocking-calls, Multiple task at a time,

# Task speed depends upon Internet speed, Server speed, etc.

# 3 ways to perform asynchronous programming in JavaScript:
    - Callbacks,
    - Promises,
    - Async/Await,

# Feature of asynchronous:
    - function that takes very large amount of time to complete execution is Asynchronous.
    - function running in parallel with other functions is Asynchronous. (i.e. setTimeout(), setInterval()),
    - function that returns promise-object is Asynchronous,

# An asynchronous function is any function that delivers its result asynchronously.
    - for example: a callback-based function or a Promise-based function.

- Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions.
- An async function is defined via special syntax, involving the keywords async and await . It is also called async/await due to these two keywords.
