- Some of Pre-defined asynchronous methods in Asynchronous JavaScript:
    - Waiting for a Timeout: setTimeout() ==> run code after given time period
    - Waiting for Intervals: setInterval() ==> run code in every given time interval
    - Waiting for Files: XMLHttpRequest()
    - Waiting for Resposne-Data from API-url: fetch()

- callback waits untill asynchronous gets done.

- Asynchronous itself takes time to return data but doesnt stop the flow to programing execution.
- Generally asynchronous in JS return promises.
