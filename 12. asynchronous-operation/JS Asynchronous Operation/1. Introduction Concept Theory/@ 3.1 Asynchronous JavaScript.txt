Q. What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous in JavaScript?
    - In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is completed, the following is blocked.
    - In other words, you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one.
    - In asynchronous operations, on the other hand, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes.

- By defualt, JavaScript is synchronous.
- But we can perform asynchronous operation in JavaScript using three ways:
        >Async/Await, >Callbacks, >Promises
