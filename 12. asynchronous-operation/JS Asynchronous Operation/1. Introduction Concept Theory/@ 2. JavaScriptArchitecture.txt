- Synchronous Client vs Asynchronous Client,
- Synchronous Server vs Asynchronous Server,

- when we make a function/method-call (i.e network-call, local-call, server-call, disk-call), fetching something.
- As a client if i decided to wait for the result/response of coressponding request from the sources(network, local, server)before excuting futher code, then i am acting as a synchronous client.
- In contrast;
- In Asynchronous, when you make a request to sources(network, local, server), so to calculate response, it might take time. But this time we will not wait untill resopnse get ready, instead we provide callback-function which will execute when ever response(success/fail) is ready and continue executing our code.

- Synchronous: wait until the execution of current code statement is finished inorder to run futher code-execution,
- Asynchronous: no wait until the execution of current code statement is finished inorder to run futher code-execution,

- Both architecture has pros and cons.

- Example of Synchronous Architeture:
    function upload(){
        print("Youtube vedio uploading")
        v = YoutubeUploader() // here YoutubeUploader is synchronous, so excution of code stops here until success/failure response.
        print("Success", v) // then this line get executed.
    }
- In Synchronous, you can see when you upload vedio on youtube your youtube-UI is blocked untill success/fail.
- In constrast,
- In Asynchronous, you can see when you upload vedio on youtube your youtube-UI is not blocked untill success/fail, you can change title of vedio, get url of vedio even uploading is still in process.

- callback function is called inside asynchronous function.

- callback can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous
- synchronous callback
- asynchronous callback

- synchronous function
- asynchronous function

- Synchronous: wait,
- Asynchronous: not wait.

- asynchronous & callback
- promise| then| catch
- async - await

- some of native browser asynchronous function(that takes some time to return response):
    - setTimeout(),
    - fetch(),
